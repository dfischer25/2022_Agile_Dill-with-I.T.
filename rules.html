    <h3>Pickleball Basics</h3>
    <p>
        Pickleball has many similarities to tennis. Similar to tennis, Pickleball can be played as either singles or doubles 
        and when serving in pickleball you must serve to the box that is kiddy corner from where you are serving. Unlike tennis,
        you serve underhand in pickleball.
