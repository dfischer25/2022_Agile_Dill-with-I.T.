    <h3>Pickleball Rules</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Pickleball has many similarities to tennis. The most obvious difference is the size of the court. Pickleball is played on a that
        is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide. Another difference is the equipment. Pickleball is played with small wooden or plastic paddles
        and a ball the size of a tennis ball but similar in material to a wiffle ball. It is the same dimensions as a badminton court.
        Similar to tennis, Pickleball can be played as either singles or doubles. In pickleball, both singles and double are played on the
        same size court. Another similarity to tennis is when serving in pickleball you must serve to the box that is kiddy corner from
        where you are serving. Unlike tennis, you serve underhand in pickleball. The serve in pickleball is mostly used just to get the
        point started, it is not used as much of a weapon like it is in tennis. The purpose of serving underhand is you have to hit the
        ball upward so it is not as difficult to return. Games are normally played to 11 points and you only score by winning points when your team is serving.

      <div id="rules">
        <h2>Two Bounce Rule</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When the ball is served the receiving team must let the serve bounce before they can hit it.</li>
            <li>The serving team must also let return bounce before they are allowed to hit it.</li>
            <li>
                Once each team has let the ball bounce once(the serve and the return), you are allowed to hit the ball out of
                the air or let it bounce.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Non-volley Zone</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The non-volley zone runs the width of the court. It starts at the net on each side of the court and extends seven
                feet out from the net.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players are not allowed to step into the non-volley zone and hit the ball out of the air. This prevents players from
                standing right over the net and smashing the ball
            </li>
            <li>
                A player is allowed to step into the non-volley zone and hit the ball as long as they let it bounce before they hit it.
            </li>
